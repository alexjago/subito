{"id":"subito-0le","title":"Harden MuseScore detection and errors","description":"find_musescore currently raises a NameError on unsupported platforms because it references `NotImplementedException` (Subito.py:270-285), and returns None on macOS when no MuseScore binary is present before we even need it. Guard for missing MuseScore earlier with a clear error message, use `NotImplementedError`, and consider allowing a user-provided path/override so simple MIDI-only runs do not die when MuseScore is absent.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-18T21:42:40.266629+10:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T21:42:40.266629+10:00"}
{"id":"subito-2z5","title":"Handle invalid part definitions without NameError","description":"validPartDef currently references an undefined partStr when logging an invalid entry (Subito.py:109-131), so a bad PARTS entry in config triggers a NameError before the script can prompt or fallback. Replace the log variable so the offending definition is reported correctly and ensure invalid config data fails gracefully instead of crashing.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-18T21:42:08.562906+10:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T21:45:38.345886+10:00"}
{"id":"subito-7z9","title":"Allow nested output directories when mirroring source tree","description":"When processing a directory, Subito.py builds `subdir = os.path.join(args.outpath, os.path.dirname(os.path.relpath(s, args.inpath)))` (around lines 503-506) and then calls `os.mkdir(subdir)`. This explodes for inputs in nested folders because intermediate directories are missing. Switch to `os.makedirs(..., exist_ok=True)` (or similar) so mirrored output paths are created reliably, including the empty string case from find.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-18T21:42:24.613256+10:00","updated_at":"2025-12-18T21:42:24.613256+10:00"}
